# Financial-Coding-for-School-Budgets

There is a machine learning competition on drivendata.org that poses a classification problem pertaining to school budgets. 

Summary of the competition from the website:
“Budgets for schools and school districts are huge, complex, and unwieldy. It's no easy task to digest where and how schools are using their resources. Education Resource Strategies is a non-profit that tackles just this task with the goal of letting districts be smarter, more strategic, and more effective in their spending.
Your task is a multi-class-multi-label classification problem with the goal of attaching canonical labels to the freeform text in budget line items. These labels let ERS understand how schools are spending money and tailor their strategy recommendations to improve outcomes for students, teachers, and administrators.”

So essentially the goal is to use the predictor variables to predict the probability that a certain label is attached to a budget line item. The task of assigning labels to budget items is called financial coding and is very time-consuming and labor-intensive.  The right algorithm will help people do this task more accurately, quickly, and cheaply.
