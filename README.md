# Financial-Coding-for-School-Budgets (In Progress)

There is a machine learning competition on drivendata.org that poses a classification problem pertaining to school budgets. 

The goal is to use the predictor variables to predict the probability that a certain label is attached to a budget line item. The task of assigning labels to budget items is called financial coding and is very time-consuming and labor-intensive.  The right algorithm will help people do this task more accurately, quickly, and cheaply.
